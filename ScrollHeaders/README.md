# Scroll Header Callout
This is a CSS [snippet](https://gist.github.com/sailKiteV/d71a3f8e1f8aa24b44dcdfed8ee9ef69/) that adds a custom callout to Obsidian. It will style any heading on the first line of the callout's content to appear as a title to the left of the main body. This snippet is intended for use with Readable Line Length enabled. Additionally, it is intended primarily for use with Source Mode, though some Live Preview functionality is supported.  

The snippet includes an implementation for the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
