# Other Little Things
A collection of snippets and things that don't quite need their own directory. Entries prefixed by an asterisk `*` have an implementation for the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin by mgmeyers.

- \**[Text Selection Colors](https://github.com/sailKiteV/Obsidian-Snippets-and-Demos/blob/master/OtherLittleThings/TextSelectionColors.css)*: Change the color of the text, background, and caret for selected text. Optionally increase the width of the caret. Credit to Murf#2728 on the [Obsidian Members Group](https://obsidian.md/community) Discord server for the original snippet; i just dressed it up a bit.
